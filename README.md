QWIXX is a table top game played with six dice and score cards.  I enjoyed the game so much
that I built this web app as a passion project. The main goal of this project was to make the
game more accessible because it is not always practicle to roll dice, for example, in the car
or on an airplane.  To support that goal, this app scales to any size screen gracefully and
is a Progressive Web App so you can "install" it on your device to have offline access to it
everywhere.  

One design decision that I made that is important to note is that the app does not enforce
any of the game rules. Since QWIXX is a table top game, families may have house rules or decide to 
disregard certian rules all together, and I didn't to eliminate that aspect of the game.  
There is a link to the game rules included in the app so users can go read up on how to play.
